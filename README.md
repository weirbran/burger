# Eat Da Burger

### Overview

This is the 12th assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivered at University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment, we were required to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!), following the MVC design pattern. We used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### Built With

- Node.js
- Express, Express Handlebars, MySQL, Method-Override, Body Parser NPMs
- Javascript
- HTML5
